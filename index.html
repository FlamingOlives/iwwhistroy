<h1>IWW</h1>
<p>The IWW (Indusial Workers of the World), founded in 1905, was a group of people, regardless of race, sex, skill, class, religion, or ethnicity, who would come together to plan strikes and revolts to try to have a better work life. </p>

<h1>AFL</h1>
<p>The AFL (American Federation of Labor) was the opposite of the IWW. The AFL was a group of white, skilled men who would take the voice from the unskilled or white men.</p>
