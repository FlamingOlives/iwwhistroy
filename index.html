  <h1 id="subhead">IWW</h1>
  <p id="par">The IWW (Indusial Workers of the World), founded in 1905, was a group of people, regardless of race, sex, skill, class, religion, or ethnicity, who would come together to plan strikes and revolts to try to have a better work life. </p>
<br>
  <h1 id="subhead">AFL</h1>
  <p id="par">The AFL (American Federation of Labor) was the opposite of the IWW. The AFL was a group of white, skilled men who would take the voice from the unskilled or white men.</p>
<br>
  <h1 id="subhead">Owners</h1>
  <p id="par">These were the owners of factories, companies, and other organizations. In my <a href="#thesis">opinion</a>, they were the biggest roadblock for the IWW.</p>

<legend id="par">Why was the AFL bad</legend>
  <h1 id="subhead">Because</h1>
  <p id="par"> In my opinion the AFL wants "the worst" but it had some major flaws:</p><ul>
<li id="par">Limited inclusivity: The representation of the AFL was very slim, and only had only white men.</li>
<li id="par">Skill-Level: The AFL also would give jobs to anyone who was "unskilled" in any way.</li>
<li id="par">Anti-Change: The AFL also ignored issues about wages and working conditions. Without their support black people, women, and immigrants suffered.</li></ul>
<br>
  <h1 id="subhead">Trials</h1>
  <p id="par">In my opinion the AFL was bad, but they weren't the main roadblock for the IWW. The main roadblock for the IWW was the owners of factories, companies, and other organizations. The owners would run the factory and pay anyone to work. Sadly the working conditions were horrible and employees would be threatened, raped, or even fired for taking a small break. The wages were almost nothing and the hours were backbreaking, so this is how the IWW started. People banded together to fight for what was right.</p>

<legend id="par">What were the IWW tactics</legend>
  <h1 id="subhead">Why did they have them</h1>
  <p id="par">The IWW needed tactics for striking. These tactics were used so they could be unpredictable and hard to combat until they got what they deserved. An example of a striking tactic they used was, "No-work-Monday" Where they would stick every Monday and demand better conditions.</p>

<legend id="par">My Point and Thesis about the IWW, AFL, and Owners</legend>
  <p id="par">The IWW faced many problems, but the most relentless roadblock was the owners of factories and companies. Owner of factors were also the reason the IWW was made, to fight them. But they were greedy and only cared for themselves. The IWW, from the start, wanted four things:
  1) Higher wages.
  2) Smaller work week.
  3) An end to the premium system and favoritism.
  4) An end to discrimination in the workspace.
In some way, all of these were achieved, but in others, they were not. When they advocated for higher wages, the owners or supervisors would not do anything. Finally, they broke and barely increased their wages by a smidge. When they asked for fewer hours and a shorter work week, it was granted at the cost of faster work. When they tried to end the premium system of favoritism, their work was sped up more, and they had to do twice what they used to. Discrimination in the workspace has been an issue and will be for a long time (sadly). 
Conclusion: Even though the IWW was a great idea, it lost its epic battle for social workers' justice. The owners blocked them with their privilege, unfair power games, legal problems, and even spreading lies! But the IWW's spirit lives on, showing workers they can still fight for their rights against the big bosses.
