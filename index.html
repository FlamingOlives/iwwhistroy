  <h1 id="subhead">IWW</h1>
  <p>The IWW (Indusial Workers of the World), founded in 1905, was a group of people, regardless of race, sex, skill, class, religion, or ethnicity, who would come together to plan strikes and revolts to try to have a better work life. </p>

  <h1 id="subhead">AFL</h1>
  <p>The AFL (American Federation of Labor) was the opposite of the IWW. The AFL was a group of white, skilled men who would take the voice from the unskilled or white men.</p>
