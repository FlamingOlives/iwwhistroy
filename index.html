  <h1 id="subhead">IWW</h1>
  <p id="par">The IWW (Indusial Workers of the World), founded in 1905, was a group of people, regardless of race, sex, skill, class, religion, or ethnicity, who would come together to plan strikes and revolts to try to have a better work life. </p>
<br>
  <h1 id="subhead">AFL</h1>
  <p id="par">The AFL (American Federation of Labor) was the opposite of the IWW. The AFL was a group of white, skilled men who would take the voice from the unskilled or white men.</p>
<br>
  <h1 id="subhead">Owners</h1>
  <p id="par">These were the owners of factories, companies, and other organizations. In my opinion, they were the biggest roadblock for the IWW.</p>

<legend id="par">Why was the AFL bad</legend>
  <h1 id="subhead">Because</h1>
  <p id="par"> In my opinion the AFL wants "the worst" but it had some major flaws:</p><ul>
<li id="par">Limited inclusivity: The representation of the AFL was very slim, and only had only white men.</li>
<li id="par">Skill-Level: The AFL also would give jobs to anyone who was "unskilled" in any way.</li>
<li id="par">Anti-Change: The AFL also ignored issues about wages and working conditions. Without their support black people, women, and immigrants suffered.</li></ul>
<br>
  <h1 id="subhead">Trials</h1>
  <p id="par">In my opinion the AFL was bad, but they weren't the main roadblock for the IWW. The main roadblock for the IWW was the owners of factories, companies, and other organizations. The owners would run the factory and pay anyone to work. Sadly the working conditions were horrible and employees would be threatened, raped, or even fired for taking a small break. The wages were almost nothing and the hours were backbreaking, so this is how the IWW started. People banded together to fight for what was right.</p>

<legend id="par">What were the IWW tactics</legend>
  <h1 id="subhead">Why did they have them</h1>
  <p id="par">The IWW needed tactics for striking. These tactics were used so they could be unpredictable and hard to combat until they got what they deserved. An example of a striking tactic they used was, "No-work-Monday" Where they would stick every Monday and demand better conditions.</p>
